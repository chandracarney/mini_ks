After a lot of thought and planning, I initially decided to go towards a CLI that would interface with a Rails API (the storage and validations would come easily). I started test driving the API to create projects on Sunday. After I woke up on Monday, I decided to start over with a simple CLI application. Here's the implementation and documentation, feel free to follow along with my commits.
